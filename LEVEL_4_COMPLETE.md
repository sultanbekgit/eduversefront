## 🎓 What You Learned:

### **RxJS & Observables**
- `BehaviorSubject` - Holds and emits current value
- `Observable` - Stream of data that components can subscribe to
- `subscribe()` - Listen to changes in real-time
- `unsubscribe()` - Clean up to prevent memory leaks

### **Angular Lifecycle Hooks**
- `OnInit` - Initialize component (load data)
- `OnDestroy` - Clean up when component is removed

### **Routing**
- `Routes` configuration
- `RouterModule` for navigation
- `routerLink` directive for navigation links
- `routerLinkActive` for highlighting active routes
- `<router-outlet>` for displaying routed components

### **Component Communication**
- Services as shared state
- Observable pattern for reactive updates
- Subscription management
